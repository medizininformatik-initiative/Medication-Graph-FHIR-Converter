The FHIR exporter was created during my master's thesis with limited time.
As of now, it unfortunately significantly lacks automated testing and the code is difficult to read.

I decided to only include it for now without a rework, as other matters are more important right now.
(And probably will be for the forseeable future. You know how they say there's nothing more permanent than a temporary solution, right?)
