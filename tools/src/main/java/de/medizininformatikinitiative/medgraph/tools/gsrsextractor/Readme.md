This tool features two parts. The **extractor** acquires all known CAS codes from the
knowledge graph and uses them to find matching substances in the Global Substance Registration System, using the GSRS
API. If multiple substances match, all of their GSRS UUIDs are inserted into the output file.
The **refiner** can take the output file generated by the extractor and fixes any abiguities
by selecting the most fitting match using different metrics. If no single match can be selected, the corresponding GSRS
data for the CAS code used for that search is eliminated from the output.
