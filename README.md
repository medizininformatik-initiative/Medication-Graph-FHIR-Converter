This is a Java tool meant for supporting the transformation of clinical medication-related documentation from the MMI Pharmindex
into a structured FHIR format. Using it requires a Neo4j database and the [MMI Pharmindex data](https://www.mmi.de/mmi-pharmindex/mmi-pharmindex-daten) to be available. (The latter is sadly not available for free, but that is also the reason I can't distribute it here.)

It currently comprises three core features:
- Setting up a knowledge graph containing data related to pharmaceutical products in a Neo4j database
- Using the knowledge graph to create FHIR **Medication**, **Substance**, and **Organization** instances
- Searching pharmaceutical products in the knowledge graph

For documentation on how to use, head over to the [wiki](https://github.com/medizininformatik-initiative/Medication-Graph-FHIR-Converter/wiki).
