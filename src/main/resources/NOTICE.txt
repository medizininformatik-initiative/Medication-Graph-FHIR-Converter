This project uses data copies from external data sources which may not be up to date!

For one, the internal file amice_stoffbezeichnungen_utf8.csv is the 2023 version of this file as provided by the German Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices.
From this file we extract CAS numbers, INNs and synonymes for substances and link them via the ASK.

The UNIIs and RXCUIs are from the Global Substance Registration System and were extracted on 2023-11-30 via the public GSRS api via known CAS numbers.

The EDQM dosage form terms are taken from the EDQM Standard Terms database and are reproduced with permission of the European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines & HealthCare, Council of Europe (EDQM).
The data has been retrieved on 2023-10-16. Since the EDQM Standard Terms database is not a static list, this data may not be up-to-date. They have been mapped to the MMI Pharmindex dose forms via a manually crafted mapping table.

Additionally, the database gets initialized using provided MMI Pharmindex data. As such, how up-to-date other information is depends on the version of the used data set.

Finally, be advised data from any of the given sources may contain errors, which would propagate into the output produced by this tool.
